# Aim: To Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

# Algorithm: Develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

The process will showcase how to create a prompt-based application step-by-step, gradually increasing in sophistication to demonstrate how the application evolves in both functionality and complexity.

Step 1: Basic Task Organization (Simple Prompt)
In the initial stage, the user will input a simple list of tasks for the day. ChatGPT will output a basic to-do list without any advanced categorization.

Prompt:
"Create a to-do list for today with the following tasks: [Task 1], [Task 2], [Task 3]."

Expected Output:
Today's To-Do List:

Task 1

Task 2

Task 3

This is a straightforward application where tasks are listed without prioritization or scheduling. The output is clear and simple, displaying tasks for the day.

Step 2: Task Prioritization and Time Management
Now we introduce the concept of prioritizing tasks, with a focus on time management. The user will input tasks, and the system will organize them into priority categories (e.g., High, Medium, Low) along with estimated completion times.

Prompt:
"Organize the following tasks by priority (High, Medium, Low): [Task 1], [Task 2], [Task 3]. Include estimated time for each task."

Expected Output:
Today's To-Do List with Priorities:

High Priority: Task 1 (2 hours)

Medium Priority: Task 2 (1 hour)

Low Priority: Task 3 (30 mins)

In this step, the prompt is slightly more advanced, providing useful categorization of tasks by their importance and expected duration. This helps in making informed decisions on what to tackle first.

Step 3: Time Blocking and Scheduling with Breaks
This is where task scheduling and efficient time blocking come in. The application now suggests a structured schedule that includes time for breaks.

Prompt:
"Schedule the following tasks with time blocks and include breaks: [Task 1], [Task 2], [Task 3]. Be sure to optimize for productivity."

Expected Output:
Optimized Daily Schedule:

9:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Task 1 (High Priority)

11:00 AM - 11:15 AM: Break

11:15 AM - 12:15 PM: Task 2 (Medium Priority)

12:15 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch Break

1:00 PM - 2:00 PM: Task 3 (Low Priority)

Here, the user gets a detailed daily schedule with specific time blocks, including regular breaks for better productivity and work-life balance.

Step 4: Daily Reflection and Tomorrow’s Task Preparation
For a more advanced application, this stage allows users to review their day and provide a reflection on their completed tasks. Additionally, it will generate suggestions to help them improve for the next day.

Prompt:
"Review the following tasks that were completed today: [Task 1], [Task 2], [Task 3]. What went well and what could be improved for tomorrow?"

Expected Output:
Daily Review:

Completed: Task 1, Task 2

Missed: Task 3
What Went Well: Task 1 was completed on time, and Task 2 was finished early.
What Could Be Improved: Task 3 took longer than expected; next time, break it down into smaller steps.
Suggestion for Tomorrow: Prioritize the smaller tasks in the morning for a faster start.

This feature promotes self-reflection and continuous improvement, fostering better time management and task organization over time.

Step 5: Automated Reminders and Notifications
The final step introduces automation by setting up reminders for upcoming tasks and notifications to keep the user on track throughout the day.

Prompt:
"Set up reminders for these tasks: [Task 1], [Task 2], [Task 3]. Remind me 30 minutes before each task."

Expected Output:
Task Reminder Notifications:

Reminder for Task 1: 8:30 AM

Reminder for Task 2: 10:30 AM

Reminder for Task 3: 1:30 PM

In this step, reminders act as notifications, helping users stay on top of their tasks by alerting them ahead of time.





# Result: The Prompt is executed successfully
By progressing from basic task listing to advanced task scheduling, prioritization, and automated reminders, you’ll have created a functional and dynamic prompt-based application that adapts to the user's personal needs and preferences.

Execution Outcome:
The final application, after executing the relevant prompts, will effectively organize daily tasks and improve overall productivity with features that grow in sophistication over time. This will lead to increased creativity and problem-solving skills as users become better at managing their time and workload.
